# Data Science Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection


Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft. With an estimated 1.5 billion credit cards in the U.S. alone, itâ€™s no surprise that millions of people fall as victims every year (Brex).

It is not a challenging problem only for credit cardholders, but also for banks, government, insurance companies, the public sector, sales, and healthcare.

In this scenario, machine learning plays an essential role in fraud detection. It uses supervised methods (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, time-series analysis, etc.) and unsupervised methods (cluster analysis, principal component analysis, etc.) to accurately predict when a fraud transaction occurs in the system so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

This project is intended to analyse a data set that contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
